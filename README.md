  * Business Statistics: A First Course, Third Edition, by Sharpe, De Veaux, and Velleman, narrows the gap between theory and practice―relevant statistical methods empower business students to make effective, data-informed decisions. With their unique blend of teaching, consulting, and entrepreneurial experiences, this dynamic author team brings a modern edge to teaching statistics to business students. Focusing on statistics in the context of real business issues–with an emphasis on analysis and understanding over computation–the text helps students think analytically, prepares them to make better business decisions, and shows them how to effectively communicate results.
